ML Kit for iOS: Recognizing Text in Images

## ML Kit

ML Kit is a mobile SDK that brings Google’s ML expertise to your app. There are two main parts of ML Kit’s APIs for common use cases and custom models that are easy to use regardless of experience.

The existing APIs currently support:

- [x] [Recognizing text](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/recognize-text)
- [ ] [Detecting faces](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/detect-faces)
- [ ] [Identifying landmarks](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/recognize-landmarks)
- [ ] [Scanning barcodes](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/read-barcodes)
- [ ] [Labeling images](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/label-images)

Each of these use cases comes with a pre-trained model wrapped in an easy-to-use API
